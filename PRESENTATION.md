### A long time ago, there was a war.  


+ In early 1918, the Germans needed a cipher that would provide moving troops with encryption that was both convenient and secure.  

+ The man tasked with the job was Signal Corps Lieutenant **Fritz Nebel** (1891â€“1977), and he soon developed what he called the _Geheimschrift der Funker 1918_ (in short _GedeFu 18_).  

+ By June, the cipher was being used to blare messages from German radio messages all over the Western Front. The Germans prided themselves on their invention, and believed it was **uncrackable**.  

## _Part Two: The Cipher_

The following is the encoding algorithm Fritz Nebel developed over a century ago.
### Section One: Polybius Square
The first part of the encoding process requires us to make a Polybius Square. Also known as a Polybius Checkerboard, this device was first used by the Ancient Greeks to represent complex messages with a smaller set of characters.  

Say we want to encode the message `attacktmrw`. This step requires the first of two keywords we'll need for the whole process, so let's choose `belgium`. The headings of our Polybius square will be the letters `a`, `d`, `f`, `g`, `v`[^1], and `x`. Instead of simply inserting the entire alphabet and the digits `0` to `9` into the square, first extract the characters that comprise the first keyword and move them to the front. Using our example, our square would look something like this.

Each letter of our plaintext message is then encrypted as the two "code" letters that represent its position, starting with the letter that marks its row (the y-axis, if you will). So, `a` becomes `DD`. `t` becomes `GF`, and so on. After this first step, `attacktmrw` is now written as `DDGFGFDDDFFDGFDAGAGV`.  

### Section Two: Columnar Transposition

Now, we need our second keywork, so let's choose `short`. That intermediate ciphered text we just created in the last step is written in rows beneath `short`. We now have this:
|**S**    |**H**    |**O**    |**R**|**T**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|D|D|G|F|G|
|F|D|D|D|F|
|F|D|G|F|D|
|A|G|A|G|V|

Next, we number each letter of the keyword in alphabetical order, creating this:
|**S**    |**H**    |**O**    |**R**|**T**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|4|1|2|3|5|
|D|D|G|F|G|
|F|D|D|D|F|
|F|D|G|F|D|
|A|G|A|G|V|

Finally, read off the intermediate ciphered text down the columns, starting with the column labeled `1` and ending with the column labeled `5`. Our final ciphered text, therefore, is `DDDG GDGA FDFG DFFA GFDV`.

[^1]: These specific letters were deliberately chosen because they appear very dissimilar when written in Morse code, making communicating messages a lot easier and a lot less prone to human error. Initially, the headings of the Polybius square only had the letters `a`, `d`, `f`, `g`, and `x`. The `v` was added a few months later to allow for the encryption of the full alphabet and the digits `0` to `9` (in total, 36 characters).
