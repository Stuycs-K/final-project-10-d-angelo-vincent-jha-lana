### A long time ago, there was a war.  

+ In early 1918, the Germans needed a cipher that would provide moving troops with encryption that was both convenient and secure.  

+ The man tasked with the job was Signal Corps Lieutenant **Fritz Nebel** (1891â€“1977), and he soon developed what he called the _Geheimschrift der Funker 1918_ (in short _GedeFu 18_).  

+ By June, the cipher was being used to blare messages from German radio messages all over the Western Front. The Germans prided themselves on their invention, and believed it was **uncrackable**.
